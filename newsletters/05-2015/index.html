  <h2>May 2015</h2>
  <p>May was a busy month, but I still managed to read some terrific books. If like me, you&#39;re finding it hard to make time to read, here&#39;s a quick tip. Choose a manageable number of pages to read each day and turn it into a daily habit. 20 pages is a good place to start, and it adds up to 36 books a year. That&#39;s a lot of reading, and it&#39;s a great investment. </p>

<p>If there was a loose theme to my reading this month, it&#39;s changing the world. From the invention of the airplane to the emergence of Sapiens, these books demonstrate our species&#39; tendency to push beyond boundaries and shape the world according to our desires -- for better and worse.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1KGhnik">The Wright Brothers</a></strong> by <em>David McCullough</em></p>

<p>I think McCullough is one of the best popular history writers of all time. His biography of <a href="http://amzn.to/1Fnn5Pi">John Adams</a> is incredible, and it formed the basis of the equally impressive HBO series starring Paul Giamatti. The Wright Brothers is the latest in a long list of bestsellers for the two-time ulitzer winner. It&#39;s a vivid account of the birth of powered flight -- not a history of airplanes, but of the two brilliant bicycle mechanics who willed them into existence through sheer intellect and unwavering commitment. If you fly a lot like I do, you&#39;ll appreciate this book, even more so the next time you&#39;re <a href="https://youtu.be/uEY58fiSK8E?t=2m">sitting in a chair in the sky</a> browsing the web at 36,000 feet.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1EIXXB2">How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life</a></strong> by <em>Russ Roberts</em></p>

<p>I&#39;d heard good things about this book, but it wasn&#39;t until I picked it up in a bookstore and read the introduction that I decided to buy it. Roberts is a popular economist (check out his <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/">EconTalk podcast</a>), but he didn&#39;t read The Wealth of Nations or the long-neglected Theory of Moral Sentiments until late in his career. He was so impressed by the latter that he decided to write this book. With chapter titles like &#39;How to be Happy&#39;, &#39;How to be Good&#39;, and &#39;How to Make the World a Better Place&#39;,  it&#39;s a quick and enjoyable introduction to a forgotten classic. Whether you decide to read The Theory of Moral Sentiments or not, definitely check this book out. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1KwxjQO">Sapiens</a></strong> by <em>Yuval Noah Harari</em></p>

<p>100,000 years ago there were at least 6 species of humans on the planet, yet today we are the sole survivors. Why? That&#39;s the central question of Harari&#39;s book, billed as a brief history of humankind. It&#39;s a whirlwind tour through the whole of our history, focusing on our major revolutions: cognitive, agricultural, and scientific. Sapiens will forever alter your opinion of what happens when humans arrive in an environment (in short, we destroy it), and it concludes with a speculative look into the future of our species. This is a stunning work and I&#39;m excited to read more from Harari in the future. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1KGhRVC">Zero to One</a></strong> by <em>Peter Theil</em></p>

<p>Peter Theil - cofounder of PayPal and Palantir, President of Clarium Capitol, and first outside investor in Facebook - knows a thing or two about starting companies. In Zero to One he argues that most businesses take the world from 1 to N. They add a little value to a familiar idea. As someone who was once approached to build &quot;Facebook for pets&quot;, I can attest to this. But occasionally a company creates something completely new and takes the world from 0 to 1. As Theil says in the introduction, &quot;the next Larry Page and Sergei Brin won&#39;t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won&#39;t create a social network&quot;. We can do better than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_(app)">Yo! app</a>, and this book is a call to do so.  </p>

<p>I just celebrated my 34th(!) birthday, and I received a ton of books that I can&#39;t wait to read and share with you. If you want to say hi or tell me about a book you enjoyed, please do! I&#39;d love to hear from you, and all you have to do is reply to this email.</p>

<p>You&#39;re awesome. Until next month, </p>

<p>Kyle</p>
