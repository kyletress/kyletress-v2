  <h2>July 2015</h2>
  <p>Maybe you&#39;ve experienced this before. You read a book with a specific theme, place, or genre, and the next thing you know you’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and you can’t <em>stop</em> reading about it. That happened to me this month. It kicked off with <a href="http://amzn.to/1IyDwNE"><em>Armada</em></a> by Ernest Cline. I enjoyed <em>Armada</em>, but not as much as Cline’s first novel <a href="http://amzn.to/1I7LfAU"><em>Ready Player One</em></a> (one of my favorite books). </p>

<p>Armada led me to a bunch of other books in the space genre, but I’m going to skip over them (with two exceptions) since they aren’t for everyone. If you’re curious, just reply to this email and I’ll send you those, too.     </p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1hbdOEW"><strong>The Martian</strong></a> by <em>Andy Weir</em></p>

<p>I am so excited to see Matt Damon portray astronaut Mark Watney in the upcoming film adaptation of this book. The Martian is about an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars, and is presumed dead. Watney must figure out a way to survive, contact Earth, and get home. Fast and fun.  </p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1KEuPDY"><strong>Where is Everybody</strong></a> by <em>Stephen Webb</em></p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t resist this book, because it covers one of my favorite thought experiments of all time. In 1950, physicist Enrico Fermi asked his colleagues a simple question. In a galaxy as large as ours (400 Billion stars), the numbers suggest we should see some sign of life - so “where is everybody?”. There are several possible solutions to the <em>Fermi Paradox</em>, but regardless of which you prefer, the important thing is <em>how</em> you think about it. Fermi was famous for asking seemingly unanswerable questions, like “how many piano tuners are there in Chicago?”. These kinds of questions improve our skills in estimation, statistics, and logical thinking. Before you dive into it, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">the wikipedia page on the Fermi Paradox</a>, and an introduction on the <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html">Wait but Why blog</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1SoH2Rc"><strong>Better Than Before</strong></a> by <em>Gretchen Rubin</em></p>

<p>After the Sochi Winter Olympics, I took a look at my habits and identified some areas in need of change. Since then I&#39;ve been a sucker for books on the science of habit. Enter Gretchen Rubin, author of the NYT Bestseller <a href="http://amzn.to/1LV8KzA"><em>The Happiness Project</em></a>. Her latest book is a detailed look at habits, and it includes a ton of original research in how we form, change, and ultimately are our habits.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1KEuZer"><strong>The Antidote</strong></a>: Happiness for People Who Can’t Stand Positive Thinking by <em>Oliver Burkeman</em></p>

<p>The power of positive thinking. We hear it from talking heads, self-help authors, and new age gurus. Inane books like <em>The Secret</em> promote it as the key to happiness. But what if positive thinking wasn’t helping, but <em>hurting</em> us instead? That’s the premise of this insightful, thought-provoking book. The chapter on Stoicism is alone worth the price. </p>

<p>The Stoics say we have it all backwards. Instead of thinking about the good that could happen, we should focus on how much <em>worse</em> things could be — and they could always be worse. Millenia ago they popularized a technique called negative visualization where one contemplates the loss of things they love, so they are better prepared to deal with it when the loss inevitably occurs. Our modern gut instinct might say this is morbid, but in reality it makes us grateful, appreciative, and understanding of the fact that we have limited control over the universe. For more on Stoicism, check out <a href="http://amzn.to/1IOZXQK"><em>A Guide to the Good Life</em></a> by William Irvine. </p>

<p>Enjoy, and see you next month!</p>

<p>Kyle</p>
