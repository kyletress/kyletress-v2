<p>I just returned from our annual USA Bobsled/Skeleton Team Camp in Colorado Springs, CO. I managed to resist the lure of in-flight WiFi, so I was able to catch up on a ton of reading. Flying presents a great opportunity to binge read – if you aren’t glued to the window like I usually am. But the window held me captive for a different reason this trip. My flight was greatly enhanced by the writing of 747 pilot Mark Vanhoenacker, whose brilliant debut book tops my recommendations this month. But before we get to the books, I have a quick request. If you know someone who might enjoy my recommendations, please forward this email to them. It would mean a lot to me! And remember, you can always reach out to me with questions or recommendations of your own. Just reply directly to this email. Now let’s get to the books!</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1ejk4bT">Skyfaring</a></strong> by <em>Mark Vanhoenacker</em></p>

<p>If you find yourself boarding a plane this summer, buy this book and read it on the flight. Vanhoenacker can <em>really</em> write. He’s one of the most original voices I’ve read in a long time. Skyfaring defies categorization. It’s a love letter to aviation, but it’s more poetic than technical. Even if you aren’t a fan of flying, Skyfaring is worth your time. This is a brilliant debut book that’s already in the running for my favorite book of the year.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1LUW6yR">Tomorrowland</a></strong> by <em>Steven Kotler</em></p>

<p>I’ve read everything Kotler has written, from <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1ejkPBE">The Rise of Superman</a></em> to his excellent collaborations with Peter Diamandis (<em><a href="http://amzn.to/1LUWAF9">Abundance</a></em> and <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1LDi0so">Bold</a></em>). Tomorrowland is about science fiction turned fact. With short chapters on topics like asteroid mining. genetic engineering, and bionic implants, the future is arriving. Kotler has written an excellent guide on what to expect when it gets here. Pair with <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1GO9JfM">The Physics of the Future</a></em> by Michio Kaku for a deeper look.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1GOa9m9">On the Shortness of Life</a></strong> by <em>Seneca</em></p>

<p>I bring a physical copy of this book with me when I travel, partly because it’s such a short book, but mostly because I learn something new every time I read it. I find Seneca to be the most interesting of the Stoics. He lived during a dangerous time, in an empire governed by a megalomaniacal tyrant. Though we may never know the <em>real</em> Seneca, especially in regard to his role in Nero’s crimes, his work has survived the centuries because it is packed with incredible insight into the art of living. “Life is long if you know how to use it”. For more on the life of Seneca, check out <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1ejlAL8">Dying Every Day</a></em> by James Romm. It reads more like historical fiction than straight history.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1FRjpEz">Jurassic Park</a></strong> by <em>Michael Crichton</em></p>

<p>I couldn’t resist. With Jurassic World ruling the box office, I had to reread the book that started it all. The last time I read this book was in 2008 on a long drive between Calgary and Salt Lake City. I remember being amazed by how much more violent it was was compared to its PG-13 counterpart. Mostly I was impressed by Chrichton’s ability to blend hard science with fast-paced storytelling. My rereading didn’t disappoint, and if you haven’t yet read Jurassic Park, now is a good time. It’s a great beach book.</p>

<p>Have a great July. Until next month,</p>
