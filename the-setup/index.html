    <p>Hi I'm Kyle Tress. I'm an <a href="/skeleton">Olympic skeleton athlete</a> and software developer at instaviser. When I'm not racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour, I like to read, write, and code.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Kyle Tress, an Olympic skeleton athlete and software developer. I race headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour.</p>

<h2>What hardware are you using?</h2>

<p>I&#39;m an Apple guy. My work machine is a base model 12&quot; MacBook which I primarily use for writing, designing, and coding. Outside of work, the iPad Air 2 is my go-to device. The multitasking features of iOS 9 are amazing, so much so that I prefer iOS to OS X for general use.</p>

<p>My iPhone 6 is an extension of my brain, and I never leave home without it. I use it to capture ideas, browse the web, listen to podcasts, shoot 1 second videos, and update social media. It&#39;s my primary camera.</p>

<p>I bought an Apple Watch on launch day, and I love it. I keep all my devices on silent and trust the watch to relay important information. It&#39;s also a great training and travel partner. Using Apple Pay is frictionless, and I&#39;m eagerly awaiting the day when it replaces my wallet.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an avid reader. I cut cable to make more time for the unread books on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindle">Kindle Voyage</a>, but I still enjoy Netflix and Hulu Plus on my AppleTV. I have a Wii U for the occasional Zelda/Mario Kart fix.      </p>

<p>I&#39;m on the road 6 months per year. I love airplanes almost as much as I love Apple, but I couldn&#39;t survive a long flight without my Beats Solo headphones. While traveling, essentials get packed in my Scottevest Revolution jacket, and the rest goes in my Tom Bihn aeronaut and copilot. I throw in an AeroPress, Hario Grinder, and an electric travel kettle and I&#39;m all set to make great coffee wherever my sled takes me.</p>

<h2>And what software?</h2>

<p>I write long form content in Ulysses. Atom is my code editor of choice.</p>

<p>I prefer Safari for daily browsing. I couldn&#39;t imagine life without 1password, and integration with iOS 8 extensions has made it much more convenient.  </p>

<p>I use too many iOS apps to mention, but a few favorites include Netflix, NYTimes, Alien Blue, NFL GamePass, Diet Coda, Day One, Sky Guide, and GoodReader.</p>

<p>I try to live in the cloud as much as possible. My code is on GitHub, and I rely heavily on iCloud. The fewer items on my local computer, the better.   </p>

<h2>What would be your dream setup?</h2>

<p>I&#39;m really happy with my current setup. I&#39;ll probably get a retina iMac for my design/development work when I stop traveling so much. I would upgrade my office with a standing/sitting desk, ergonomic office chair, and if I was really fancy, an Eames Lounge for reading and relaxing.  </p>
