No, I'm definitely not insane. Skeleton athletes are just a little eccentric. You have to be to enjoy the sport and to be competitive, because there are certainly scary moments. Truthfully skeleton isn't terribly dangerous as long as everyone follows the rules and pays attention. I'm more concerned with the things outside of my control than those under my control.
