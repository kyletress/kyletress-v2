<p>I preordered <em>The Obstacle is the Way</em> shortly after Ryan announced the book. I’m a fan of his <a href="">reading recommendations newsletter</a>, upon which <a href="/reading-recommendations">my own</a> is based. Stoicism is growing in popularity, and it’s refreshing to see classics like <em>Meditations</em> and <em>Letters from a Stoic</em> once again get their time in the spotlight. Aurelius, Seneca, and the rest of the Stoics continue to inspire readers despite significant cultural, technological, and historical distance. In this book, Ryan illustrates Stoic principals through the use of historical anecdotes, from the Battle of Vicksburg to the rise of the Rockefellers.</p>
