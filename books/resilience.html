<p>Greitens is a Navy SEAL, Rhode Scholar, author of the New York Times Bestseller <em>The Heart and the Fist</em>, and candidate for Governor of Missouri. Here he offers something reminiscent of Seneca. Resilience is presented as a series of letters between Greitens and a former SEAL teammate who is suffering from PTSD. Like Seneca, this is a book worth dipping into from time to time.</p>
