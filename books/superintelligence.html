<p>Iâ€™m loving this book by Nick Bostrom, Oxford professor and Director of the Future of Humanity Institute. Artificial Intelligence is one of my favorite subjects of study and one of the themes I build my  collection around. I consider it one of the most important topics of the 21^st century, and too few are talking about it. Bostrom discusses many possible paths to the emergence of Artificial General Intelligence and Artificial Superintelligence. These issues are of extreme importance, because we will likely only get one chance to get it right.</p>
