<p>I loved <em>Ready Player One</em>, so I bought <em>Armada</em> without a second thought. It’s a fast, fun read without much substance. Not my favorite, but it’s an enjoyable summer read. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANLVSN1MTGE9D/ref=pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;sort_by=MostRecentReview#R33QHX5T591QA2">My Amazon review</a></p>
